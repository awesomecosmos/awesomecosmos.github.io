  title = {Metallicity, ionization parameter, and pressure variations of H ii regions in the TYPHOON spiral galaxies: NGC 1566, NGC 2835, NGC 3521, NGC 5068, NGC 5236, and NGC 7793},
  journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
  abstract = {We present a spatially resolved H ii region study of the gas-phase metallicity, ionization parameter, and interstellar medium (ISM) pressure maps of six local star-forming and face-on spiral galaxies from the TYPHOON program. Self-consistent metallicity, ionization parameter, and pressure maps are calculated simultaneously through an iterative process to provide useful measures of the local chemical abundance and its relation to localized ISM properties. We constrain the presence of azimuthal variations in metallicity by measuring the residual metallicity offset Δ(O/H) after subtracting the linear fits to the radial metallicity profiles. We, however, find weak evidence of azimuthal variations in most of the galaxies, with small (mean 0.03 dex) scatter. The galaxies instead reveal that H ii regions with enhanced and reduced abundances are found distributed throughout the disk. While the spiral pattern plays a role in organizing the ISM, it alone does not establish the relatively uniform azimuthal variations we observe. Differences in the metal abundances are more likely driven by the strong correlations with the local physical conditions. We find a strong and positive correlation between the ionization parameter and the local abundances as measured by the relative metallicity offset Δ(O/H), indicating a tight relationship between local physical conditions and their localized enrichment of the ISM. Additionally, we demonstrate the impact of unresolved observations on the measured ISM properties by rebinning the data cubes to simulate low-resolution (1 kpc) observations, typical of large IFU surveys. We find that the ionization parameter and ISM pressure diagnostics are impacted by the loss of resolution such that their measured values are larger relative to the measured values on sub-H ii region scales.},

  title = {The LCO Outbursting Objects Key Project: Overview and Year 1 Status},
  journal = {The Planetary Science Journal},
  abstract = {The LCO Outbursting Objects Key (LOOK) Project uses the telescopes of the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) Network to (1) systematically monitor a sample of previously discovered over the whole sky, to assess the evolutionary state of these distant remnants from the early solar system, and (2) use alerts from existing sky surveys to rapidly respond to and characterize detected outburst activity in all small bodies. The data gathered on outbursts helps to characterize each outburst’s evolution with time, helps to assess the frequency and magnitude distribution of outbursts in general, and contributes to the understanding of outburst processes and volatile distribution in the solar system. The LOOK Project exploits the synergy between current and future wide-field surveys such as ZTF, Pan-STARRS, and LSST, as well as rapid-response telescope networks such as LCO, and serves as an excellent test bed for what will be needed for the much larger number of objects coming from Rubin Observatory. We will describe the LOOK Project goals, the planning and target selection (including the use of NEOexchange as a Target and Observation Manager or “TOM”), and results from the first phase of observations, including the detection of activity and outbursts on the giant comet C/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli–Bernstein) and the discovery and follow-up of 28 outbursts on 14 comets. Within these outburst discoveries, we present a high-cadence light curve of 7P/Pons–Winnecke with 10 outbursts observed over 90 days, a large outburst on 57P/duToit–Neujmin–Delporte, and evidence that comet P/2020 X1 (ATLAS) was in outburst when discovered.},

  abstract = {The Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) is developing a data strategy that implements data governance, data management, and data architecture practices and infrastructures. The data strategy leverages data to build trusted insights and establishes a data-centric culture. One component of the data strategy is a set of research taxonomies that describe and characterize research at IDA. We have created a dataset that consumes disparate data sources related to these taxonomies and unites them with metadata about research products and projects to create quantified analytics addressing questions about research at IDA. This dataset is curated and ingested by an interactive Shiny web application using R, which has been named I-TREE (IDA-Taxonomical Research Expertise Explorer). In this paper, I explain how we used data science to create I-TREE, which aids IDA in collecting new insights and making informed decisions.},

  abstract = {The Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) produces a variety of research deliverables such as reports, memoranda, slides, and other formats for our sponsors. Summarizing keywords from these products quickly and for efficient retrieval of information on given research topics poses a challenge. IDA has numerous initiatives for tagging products with IDA-defined taxonomies of research terms, but this is a manual and time-consuming process and must be repeated periodically to tag newer products. To address this challenge, we developed a Python-based automated tagging pipeline. In this article, we introduce the mechanics of this pipeline, highlight current results, and discuss future applications for analyzing IDA’s research in terms of these tags.},
