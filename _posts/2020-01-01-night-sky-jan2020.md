Happy New Year 2020! As we enter the new year, we do so with our eyes up to the sky. This decade brings with it more exciting advances in the field of astronomy to look forward to.

Something new I am trying out is publishing a monthly stargazing observing list with a list of targets in that month’s prominent constellations. This month’s list is based on the location of Christchurch, New Zealand, however I shall endeavour to include more locations in the future. Check it out below!
