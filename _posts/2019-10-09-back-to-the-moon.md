*In this article written for Day Five of World Space Week 2019, I write a short piece about us going back to the Moon on manned missions.*

As I mentioned in my article a few days ago, the last time humans set foot on the Moon was in December 1972. 47 years and many unmanned missions later, we have learned a lot more about the Moon than we did in 1972. Much progress has been made since then.

The questions now remains, when are we going back to the Moon? There is already much hype (especially this year, being the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landings) about going back to the Moon, and many space organisations and private companies are on it. One of the missions I’m looking forward to is NASA going back to the Moon in 2024. The aim of this mission is to land on the Lunar south pole.

Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is working on a rocket venture, Blue Origin, with the aim of launching a manned mission to the Moon, also in 2024. This is would be the first commercial manned mission to the Moon.

It is very exciting to see what the future of manned missions to the Moon will bring. Eyes to the skies!
