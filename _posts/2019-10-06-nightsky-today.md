In this article written for Day Two of World Space Week 2019, I write a short piece about what you can observe tonight in the sky, as not only is it World Space Week Day Two, but it is also International Observe the Moon Day. I am writing from Kingston, Ontario, Canada, however consult your local observatory to see what’s up in your sky!

Tonight is a beautiful night to go out observing! As it is International Observe the Moon Day, one of the objects you should definitely observe is the 53% waxing crescent moon. It rises at 2.45pm and sets at 11.57pm. It is visible mainly on the southern horizon.

Look for Saturn and Jupiter, which are very close to the Moon. Saturn and the Moon can be viewed in the same field of view!

Some constellations you can observe are Cygnus, which is high up in the middle of the sky, Pegasus on the eastern horizon, Hercules on the western horizon, and Draco on the northwestern horizon. All of these prominent constellations have fabulous targets within them which would be best viewed through telescopes!
