A few days ago, I was pondering whether the (metaphorical) glass is half-empty, or full.

A half-empty glass: it is a true statement about the glass cup, and communicates the lack of water in the glass.

A half-full glass: it is also a true statement about the same glass cup, and communicates the presence of water in the glass.

Now replace â€˜waterâ€™ with â€˜opportunityâ€™ in the above two statements: how would you rather see your glass cup now?

Replace â€˜glass cupâ€™ with â€˜lifeâ€™, and re-read the above now.

So positive thinking affects your worldview and opens up the world for you, if you see the glass as half-full: represents opportunity, knowledge, and the joy of living! Itâ€™s all about perspective, and how we choose to see things.

Just a little thought for the day! ðŸ™‚
