Hello readers! It has been a difficult past month for most of the world, with the Covid-19 pandemic growing. Most of us are in isolation, or as is the case in New Zealand, a mandatory lockdown, to prevent further spread of the virus and to protect ourselves and others. Hopefully, you are all keeping safe!

Perhaps something to try during this period of staying at home is to look towards the night sky and marvel at the cosmic wonders. This month’s stargazing list includes many Southern autumn celestial objects, including planets as well! It is based on the location of Christchurch, New Zealand. Check it out below!

Ps. if you are located in urban areas, try looking at objects above 4th magnitude, as 5th magnitude and below will be very difficult to see without using a telescope.
