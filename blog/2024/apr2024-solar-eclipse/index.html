There was no way I was going to miss totality this time, so I convinced my family to make the arduous journey to see 100% totality. <a href="https://patch.com/virginia/oldtownalexandria/2024-solar-eclipse-when-look-virginia" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Virginia was going to see 88% totality</a>, which isn’t the same, and for the price of a relatively short road trip, why not see 100% totality?</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2024-04-04-solar-eclipse/solar_eclipse_screencaps-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2024-04-04-solar-eclipse/solar_eclipse_screencaps-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2024-04-04-solar-eclipse/solar_eclipse_screencaps-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/2024-04-04-solar-eclipse/solar_eclipse_screencaps.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Path of totality, and our journey to see the eclipse.

We didn’t have to book any flights or hotels, since we were driving and staying with our family friends, but we did have to plan for traffic carefully. This is because <a href="https://www.greatamericaneclipse.com/visitation" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">anywhere from 1-3 million people would be traveling to see the eclipse, in addition to the 31 million people who already live in the path of totality</a>.

I was nervous that maybe we wouldn’t be able to see totality after all, but miraculously the clouds cleared up around 11am and stayed that way!

This was because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_effect#:~:text=The%20Purkinje%20effect%20or%20Purkinje,as%20part%20of%20dark%20adaptation." rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Purkinje effect</a>, where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_cell" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">rod</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cone</a> cells in our eyes are adapting to the change in light intensity! <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-colors-different-total-eclipse" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">This article by sciencenews.org</a> describes this effect during eclipses.</p> <p>Eventually totality ended, and the darkness started receding. I continued observing the Moon’s shadow leave the Sun, but now in the opposite direction that it had approached. As I reflected on the experience, I realized that nothing could compare to the feeling of being in totality. It was a very unique experience, and I truly understand why people become eclipse-hunters – I know I would do anything to experience totality again!</p> <h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2> <blockquote> <p>Nothing holds a candle to totality.</p> </blockquote> <p>At 20:57 in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbGUfmDSVyg&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">vlog</a>, I said the above quote when attempting to describe my experience during totality. It was truly a life-changing experience, which really made me contemplate how lucky we are to experience such a fantastical cosmic phenomenon. I did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fgbMTC30F8" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">some research on the orbital mechanics that needed to occur for this solar eclipse to happen</a>, and it truly astounds me.</p> <p>Now that the solar eclipse is over, we all have to go on with our mundane lives. But we can <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/list.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">hope to see another eclipse like this one soon</a>. There are a <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/types/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">few annular and partial eclipses</a> from now to 2026. The <a href="https://www.space.com/stargazing/eclipses/top-solar-eclipses-next-decade" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">next total solar eclipses</a> will be across Europe in Aug. 2026, northern Africa in 2027, and Australia and New Zealand in 2028. There’s a lot of opportunities if you missed out this time or if it was cloudy!</p> <p>At the start of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbGUfmDSVyg&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">vlog</a>, I raise the question if it was worth driving 6 hours just for a chance to see the eclipse. I answer that question now: yes, it absolutely was. It truly was the experience of a lifetime. I must thank my family for going along with my craziness and driving us up to Ohio, and I am especially most grateful to our family friends, who very kindly hosted us, and took us to see sunset over Lake Erie, and took us to a prime viewing location for the eclipse. &lt;3</p> <p>Here’s to the next solar eclipse!</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2024-04-04-solar-eclipse/IMG_9430-2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2024-04-04-solar-eclipse/IMG_9430-2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2024-04-04-solar-eclipse/IMG_9430-2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/2024-04-04-solar-eclipse/IMG_9430-2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Sunset over Lake Erie.
