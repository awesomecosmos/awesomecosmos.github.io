I am Aayushi Verma, a PhD researcher in computer vision and security.

Welcome to my website and blog, where I write about all things computer/data science, astronomy, research, organization & productivity, and more! All opinions are my own. 

I previously worked full-time as a data scientist at Institute for Defense Analyses. I earned my MS in Data Science from [Pace University](https://www.pace.edu/) in 2023, and my BSc in Astrophysics from [University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/) in New Zealand in 2021.
