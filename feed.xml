This poster competition is for graduate students (Master’s and PhD) to showcase our research in a visually-compelling manner, and present it in 3 minutes or less to faculty judges outside our departments. I had a fantastic time presenting my poster, and learning from other participants. Here’s what I learned from this amazing experience!</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/IMG_6507-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/IMG_6507-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/IMG_6507-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/IMG_6507.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Photo of author in front of her poster at the competition. Source: author. </div> <h2 id="1-plan-in-advance">1. Plan in advance.</h2> <p>As soon as I heard about the poster competition, I started planning my course of action, namely what project I’d be presenting about, and what part of the research I thought would be most interesting for the audience to hear about. Planning in advance also gave me the opportunity to keep thinking and brainstorming about my research and how to present a condensed yet effective story.</p> <h2 id="2-know-the-rules-and-guidelines">2. Know the rules and guidelines.</h2> <p>In order to start designing my poster, it was important to know the guidelines for the competition, including the poster size and layout, presentation time, and format of competition. Knowing this information helped me prepare my poster so that I follow the rules of the competition and avoid losing any points on technicalities.</p> <h2 id="3-prepare-and-practice-the-pitch">3. Prepare and practice the pitch.</h2> <p>Designing the poster itself was fairly easy (keep reading below for my specific design tips), but ultimately the poster is just a prop for me to convey my research to the competition judges. Therefore writing the pitch script is equally important and goes hand-in-hand with poster design (again, keep reading to learn how I wrote my pitch script). Once I wrote my pitch script and was satisfied with it, I practiced, practiced, practiced! I practiced in the shower, in the car, while walking to class, while doing the dishes – basically any moment of spare time I had, I practiced my pitch! The goal was not to memorize word-for-word the script, but rather to learn the flow of specific points in my story and key terms I wanted to say.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/CSE_Aayushi_Verma_v3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/CSE_Aayushi_Verma_v3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/CSE_Aayushi_Verma_v3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/CSE_Aayushi_Verma_v3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Low-res image of author’s poster.

Get feedback early and often.</h2> <p>As soon as I learned about the competition, I spoke with my advisor and asked him for feedback on the research I wanted to present – we had a fruitful discussion on the key points of the research that are important, and this feedback was really helpful for me as I designed my poster and pitch. As I worked on developing my narrative, I often got feedback from my labmates, my research collaborators, my friends and family, and even my professor from the Scientific Communication class I took last semester! This variety of feedback and perspectives helped me hone my poster and pitch.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/54378380691_60fa0ec35c_c-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/54378380691_60fa0ec35c_c-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/54378380691_60fa0ec35c_c-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/54378380691_60fa0ec35c_c.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Author pitching her poster to the judges during the competition. Source: <a href="https://engineering.uconn.edu/">UConn College of Engineering</a>. </div> <h2 id="5-kiss">5. KISS.</h2> <p>Given that the poster presentation time was very short (3 minutes), I had to really think deep and convey only the most important things about my research. This meant Keeping Things Stupid Simple (KISS). I used the And, But, Therefore (ABT) storytelling framework to help me KISS. Essentially, the ABT framework is great for structuring your pitch so that it hooks the audience in, introduces the problem, and keeps them engaged to hear how you solved/are solving the problem. Read more about ABT in the ‘Resources’ section below.</p> <p>Another way I KISS-ed was by using the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYk29tnxASs">Better Poster</a> format. This is a poster design format I like because of its visual simplicity, and focus on conveying key information in a visual manner. Essentially, the key takeaway in plain English should be placed in the middle of the poster, with 1-2 supporting key visuals. I’ve included the specific tips I used to design my poster in the ‘Resources’ section.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/IMG_6492-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/IMG_6492-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/IMG_6492-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/IMG_6492.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Whiteboard brainstorm of author’s ABT storytelling for pitch.

Wear comfortable shoes!</h2> <p>I wore a professional outfit, which called for my high-heeled boots – but to my great dismay, these boots were not as comfortable as I thought, and by the end of the event, my feet were killing me! This was a little distracting (and painful), and I wish I had worn my flat boots, because we were standing the whole time during the event (4-5 hours straight!). Oh well, I’ll remember for next time!</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/54378560999_8c6a951960_c-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/54378560999_8c6a951960_c-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/54378560999_8c6a951960_c-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-15-poster-comp/54378560999_8c6a951960_c.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Group photo of department and final winners of poster competition. Author standing far left. Source: <a href="https://engineering.uconn.edu/">UConn College of Engineering</a>. </div> <h2 id="7-have-alternative-versions-of-your-pitch">7. Have alternative versions of your pitch.</h2> <p>One of my greatest learnings during this competition was the necessity to “sell your science”. The ultimate winners of the competition had one thing in common: they were able to explicitly pitch their research as a sellable product to the final round judges, who were investors from industry. The judges asked them questions like, “What is the scalable value of your product?” and received dollar amounts in response. This was an eye-opening revelation for me, as thus far I had only viewed my research as “sharing knowledge to the community”, but in reality, an alternative version of this is also a market product! In fact, many common products we use today were indeed born from academia. This is also a great skill to have in academia itself, where you apply for scholarships, fellowships and grants to support your research – by identifying a clear, real-world “return on investment” from your research, it can help in making your application stand out to funding agencies.</p> <p>Later after the competition had ended, I went up and talked to the final winner: a final-year PhD student from Material Science &amp; Engineering, who presented their research on a color-changing nano-material which is lightweight and scalable – and I learned that they are already working on running 2 startups related to their research! I was fascinated hearing them talk about their journey and research – clearly they had put in the effort to really think about the real-world value of their research! One thing they recommended for learning about “selling your science” is by attending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_accelerator">seed accelerators</a> and seed pitches. Lucky for me, UConn has a great innovation program and hosts a monthly ‘Shark Tank’ style ‘Get Seeded’ event, which I’ll definitely attend to learn more about this new (to me) frontier!</p> <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2> <p>Ultimately, my goal for taking part in the poster competition is because I love talking about my research, and learning about my peers’ research too! What’s a more fun way to do this than a poster competition? Furthermore this is great practice for conferences and building science communication skills – I highly recommend anyone to take part in such events – no matter what level you’re at (undergrad, Master’s, PhD, or beyond!). I especially love listening to the questions I get asked about my research – it helps me understand how others perceive my work, and enables me to better understand and explain my research. Finally, it’s a great way to connect with community and build a professional network!</p> <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2> <h4 id="how-i-designed-my-poster">How I Designed My Poster</h4> <p>I used PowerPoint to design my poster! I used &gt;90pt font size for the big takeaway statement at the top, 60pt for headers, and 36pt for main body text. I chose a color palette of shades of blue, with an accent of orange for some contrast. I matched my bar chart of results to the same color palette, and matched keywords related to each of the columns of data as well, to make it visually easy to match up. I used <a href="https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/">QRCode Monkey</a> to generate the QR code which points to the project website, and <a href="https://coolors.co/">coolors.co</a> to choose colors for my palette! One thing I forgot to include in my final version is my name and department, as I had been cycling through different versions of my poster before settling on this one, whoops!</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/">https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/</a></li> <li><a href="https://coolors.co/">https://coolors.co/</a></li> </ul> <h4 id="better-poster">Better Poster</h4> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYk29tnxASs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYk29tnxASs</a></li> <li><a href="https://osf.io/6ua4k">https://osf.io/6ua4k</a></li> <li><a href="https://betterposters.blogspot.com/2019/04/critique-morrison-billboard-poster.html">https://betterposters.blogspot.com/2019/04/critique-morrison-billboard-poster.html</a></li> </ul> <h4 id="and-but-therefore">And, But, Therefore</h4> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERB7ITvabA4&amp;t=5s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERB7ITvabA4&amp;t=5s</a></li> <li><a href="https://katrinawesencraft.com/2021/08/11/creating-a-narrative-with-and-but-therefore/">https://katrinawesencraft.com/2021/08/11/creating-a-narrative-with-and-but-therefore/</a></li> </ul> <h4 id="3mt-3-minute-thesis">3MT (3-Minute Thesis)</h4> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.animateyour.science/post/how-to-write-a-winning-3mt-script">https://www.animateyour.science/post/how-to-write-a-winning-3mt-script</a></li> <li><a href="https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/resources/3mt-competitor-guide">https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/resources/3mt-competitor-guide</a></li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="science-communication"/><category term="data-visualization"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently participated in my university's College of Engineering Annual Poster Competition, and won 1st place for my department (Department of Computer Science and Engineering)!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On the Power of Positive Thinking</title><link href="https://awesomecosmos.github.io/blog/2025/positive-thinking/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On the Power of Positive Thinking"/><published>2025-02-28T08:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-28T08:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://awesomecosmos.github.io/blog/2025/positive-thinking</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://awesomecosmos.github.io/blog/2025/positive-thinking/"><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, I was pondering whether the (metaphorical) glass is half-empty, or full.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-28-postive-thinking/stock_half_full_or_empty_glass-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-28-postive-thinking/stock_half_full_or_empty_glass-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-28-postive-thinking/stock_half_full_or_empty_glass-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-28-postive-thinking/stock_half_full_or_empty_glass.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Half-full, or half-empty?

There are no words for this experience, and yet in this article, I’ll find them and describe just how amazing it was! I also recorded a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbGUfmDSVyg&amp;feature=youtu.be">vlog</a> narrating my live experiences watching the solar eclipse!</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbGUfmDSVyg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" width="auto" height="auto"/> </figure> </div> <p>The last time there was a total solar eclipse visible from North America, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_21,_2017">it was 2017</a>.

I consoled myself with the fact that the next solar eclipse was in 2024 – 7 years later – and that I’d make sure not to miss it that time.</p> <p>Fast-forward to 2024, the time has come for the solar eclipse, and the path of 100% <a href="https://eclipse.aas.org/eclipse-america/eclipse-glossary">totality</a> is at minimum a 6-hour drive from where I live in Virginia, and at most 11 hours (if I wanted to go all the way up to Maine or Vermont). There was no way I was going to miss totality this time, so I convinced my family to make the arduous journey to see 100% totality. <a href="https://patch.com/virginia/oldtownalexandria/2024-solar-eclipse-when-look-virginia">Virginia was going to see 88% totality</a>, which isn’t the same, and for the price of a relatively short road trip, why not see 100% totality?</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2024-04-04-solar-eclipse/solar_eclipse_screencaps-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2024-04-04-solar-eclipse/solar_eclipse_screencaps-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2024-04-04-solar-eclipse/solar_eclipse_screencaps-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024-04-04-solar-eclipse/solar_eclipse_screencaps.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Path of totality, and our journey to see the eclipse.

We didn’t have to book any flights or hotels, since we were driving and staying with our family friends, but we did have to plan for traffic carefully. This is because <a href="https://www.greatamericaneclipse.com/visitation">anywhere from 1-3 million people would be traveling to see the eclipse, in addition to the 31 million people who already live in the path of totality</a>.

This was because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_effect#:~:text=The%20Purkinje%20effect%20or%20Purkinje,as%20part%20of%20dark%20adaptation.">Purkinje effect</a>, where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_cell">rod</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell">cone</a> cells in our eyes are adapting to the change in light intensity! <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-colors-different-total-eclipse">This article by sciencenews.org</a> describes this effect during eclipses.</p> <p>Eventually totality ended, and the darkness started receding. I continued observing the Moon’s shadow leave the Sun, but now in the opposite direction that it had approached. As I reflected on the experience, I realized that nothing could compare to the feeling of being in totality. It was a very unique experience, and I truly understand why people become eclipse-hunters – I know I would do anything to experience totality again!</p> <h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2> <blockquote> <p>Nothing holds a candle to totality.</p> </blockquote> <p>At 20:57 in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbGUfmDSVyg&amp;feature=youtu.be">vlog</a>, I said the above quote when attempting to describe my experience during totality. It was truly a life-changing experience, which really made me contemplate how lucky we are to experience such a fantastical cosmic phenomenon. I did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fgbMTC30F8">some research on the orbital mechanics that needed to occur for this solar eclipse to happen</a>, and it truly astounds me.</p> <p>Now that the solar eclipse is over, we all have to go on with our mundane lives. But we can <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/list.html">hope to see another eclipse like this one soon</a>. There are a <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/types/">few annular and partial eclipses</a> from now to 2026. The <a href="https://www.space.com/stargazing/eclipses/top-solar-eclipses-next-decade">next total solar eclipses</a> will be across Europe in Aug. 2026, northern Africa in 2027, and Australia and New Zealand in 2028. There’s a lot of opportunities if you missed out this time or if it was cloudy!</p> <p>At the start of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbGUfmDSVyg&amp;feature=youtu.be">vlog</a>, I raise the question if it was worth driving 6 hours just for a chance to see the eclipse. I answer that question now: yes, it absolutely was. It truly was the experience of a lifetime. I must thank my family for going along with my craziness and driving us up to Ohio, and I am especially most grateful to our family friends, who very kindly hosted us, and took us to see sunset over Lake Erie, and took us to a prime viewing location for the eclipse. &lt;3</p> <p>Here’s to the next solar eclipse!</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2024-04-04-solar-eclipse/IMG_9430-2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2024-04-04-solar-eclipse/IMG_9430-2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2024-04-04-solar-eclipse/IMG_9430-2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024-04-04-solar-eclipse/IMG_9430-2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Sunset over Lake Erie.

However, some of the things I wish they had done better:</p> <ul> <li>There were too many people, and not enough space in the session rooms.</li> <li>There were too many great sessions scheduled at the same time, so I had to miss out on a lot of these.</li> <li>Barely any sessions were recorded for later viewing.</li> </ul> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2024-02-19-tableau-conference-2023/love_data2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2024-02-19-tableau-conference-2023/love_data2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2024-02-19-tableau-conference-2023/love_data2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024-02-19-tableau-conference-2023/love_data2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Photo from conference photobooth, with author holding up a sign that says ‘I (heart) DATA’.

Here are my key learnings and takeaways from the talks and panel discussions:</p> <ul> <li>The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/spacecouncil/">National Space Council</a> passes space-related legislation drafts to the White House, thus shaping the United States’ space policies.</li> <li>China is making very rapid advances in the civilian and military space domain, and this pace must be matched by the U.S. to deter aggression.</li> <li>The Space Force and related agencies are building a solid path for assured access to our space portfolio, which is key for national security, defense, and public safety.</li> <li>The space industry as a whole is moving towards sustainability in space (think reusable rocket boosters and modules).</li> <li>The U.S. military, especially Space Force, has collaboration with industry and academia at the forefront of their minds, to build a meaningful partnership that benefits all parties (commercial and military).</li> <li>We need to get out of the mindset of “because that’s the way it’s always been done”, and look for unconventional ways to innovate, so we can move fast to meet needs.</li> <li>In order to promote better collaboration, the military needs to think about how to provide easier access to information — whether this is re-evaluating the way security clearances are granted to people from industry, or figuring out how to use government funding in a flexible manner.</li> <li>The lines between what is considered military technology and what is considered civilian/commercial technology are very blurred, especially in the space domain.</li> <li>Spaceports should be considered ‘critical infrastructure’.</li> <li>Some areas the Space Force and related agencies are focused on include: space access, mobility and logistics (SAML), in-orbit refueling, space domain awareness, in-space servicing, assembly and manufacturing (ISAM), and more.</li> </ul> <p>Below are some quotes from the talks and panels which I found memorable.</p> <blockquote> <p>“Now is the time to act.” — Dr. Diane Howard (National Space Council)</p> <p>“The industry’s going a mile a minute, and I love the innovation.” — Col. Richard Kniseley (U.S. Space Force)</p> <p>“Our nation needs assured access to space.” — Ret. Maj. Gen.

Some brief summaries of the talks and panel discussions I attended today:</p> <ul> <li>NASA is very focused on advancing Earth, lunar, Martian, and space exploration in 2024 and beyond, through multiple initiatives (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/">Artemis-II</a>, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/quesst/">Quesst X-59</a>, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/moontomarsarchitecture/">Moon to Mars architecture</a>, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/marshall/agency-leadership-talks-nasa-2040-artemis-budget-at-marshall-town-hall/">NASA 2040</a>, and more).</li> <li>Space technologies permeate every aspect of our lives (think imaging technology, fire-retardant clothing, GPS, etc.), and every industry should have a ‘space plan’ for how they use/work with these technologies.</li> <li>The <a href="https://www.ulalaunch.com/">United Launch Alliance (ULA)</a> is the largest ‘rocket factory’ in the world today. It was not always this way — 10 years ago, ULA exclusively supported U.S. national security missions, but they changed their strategy and went commercial, embraced competition, and repositioned their product line to meet market needs globally.</li> <li>The state of Florida, under the administration of Ron DeSantis, is the best place right now for space, with its $1.5 trillion economy, and a clear vision by the DeSantis administration to expand Florida’s aerospace industry by investing in education, healthcare, workforce development, veterans, the semiconductor industry, and more.</li> <li>Artificial intelligence has very important applications in space (astronaut safety, data &amp; predictive analytics, remote sensing, and more), but it is not trustworthy yet, and needs human-in-the-loop capabilities and guardrails.</li> <li>Private and commercial investment has not only grown rapidly, but has also diversified across every industry. Additionally, it’s a non-localized domain, which means that any event in space affects all players, regardless of geopolitics. That being said, geopolitics is a real consideration for all decisions.</li> <li>Transferable skills are very valuable in the space sector, given how multidisciplinary it is. One doesn’t necessarily need a degree in engineering to be a part of the space industry — in fact we’re seeing a lot of non-traditional education and career paths in this sector.</li> <li>The government (especially Space Force) needs to put out clear demand signals, and work with industry and commercial partners, both domestically and globally, to reach our goals. They have an unofficial motto, “Buy what you can, build what you must”, which is really key for mission success at scale.</li> <li>The Space Force, Air Force, and other branches of military are thinking about how to get younger generations (Gen Z, Gen Alpha) interested in serving our country. One way they are connecting with these younger people is by setting up gaming hubs, for example, to allow them to socialize with each other in a way they’re already used to. The games these generations have grown up with (for example <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/">Call of Duty</a>) require strategy, thinking, collaboration, etc. which translate very well to military service. They’re also using virtual and augmented reality technologies to train the younger generations!</li> </ul> <p>Some more memorable quotes from today’s speakers:</p> <blockquote> <p>“No sector in Florida is taking off more than the aerospace industry, both literally and figuratively.” — Jeanette Núñez (Lieutenant Governor of Florida)</p> <p>“The future is here, it’s just not evenly distributed.” — Owen Brown (Scientific Systems)</p> <p>“Every opportunity is also a risk.” — Neil Mickelson (Booz Allen Hamilton)</p> <p>“Turn that data into information that can help with better decision-making.” — Dr. Nelli Babayan (Microsoft Federal)</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Day Three: Thu 1 Feb — Space Congress Day #2</strong></p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2024-02-04-spacecom-conference-2024/5-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2024-02-04-spacecom-conference-2024/5-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2024-02-04-spacecom-conference-2024/5-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024-02-04-spacecom-conference-2024/5.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Former NASA astronaut, José Hernández, giving a keynote talk about his life journey. Source: author. </div> <p>This was the final day full of interesting panels and keynotes. Here’s a brief summary of the talks and panels I attended today:</p> <ul> <li>All of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/">NASA’s centers</a> have their own areas of research and applications that they specialize in, and they collaborate with each other to serve the mission, for example <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/moontomarsarchitecture/">Moon to Mars</a>.</li> <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_M._Hern%C3%A1ndez">José Hernández</a>, a former NASA astronaut, gave an amazing keynote about his inspirational journey from migrant child to NASA astronaut, and how he persevered to achieve his goal of becoming an astronaut. He’s retired now, but owns and operates his <a href="https://tierralunacellars.com/">own farm/vineyard</a>, has a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Million-Miles-Away-Michael-Pe%C3%B1a/dp/B0CC7DWDWV">biopic movie based on his life story</a>, <a href="https://tierralunaengineering.com/">consults in the aerospace industry</a>, and runs his <a href="https://astrojh.org/">own charitable foundation</a>!</li> <li>In-Space Assembly and Manufacturing (ISAM) is critical for humanity to really become space-faring. ISAM technologies will enable us to build and deploy things in space, instead of using Earth’s resources — but we need a ‘testbed’ to test various applications, for example semiconductor material growth, autonomous robotic movement, and more. Additionally, we need to make sure these technologies are reusable, sustainable, and modular to really provide best value and growth opportunities.</li> <li>One of the biggest problems in space is the huge volumes of data (for example, <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/05/04/noaa-s-data-heads-clouds">NOAA produces over 20 terabytes of data every day</a>) being captured by satellites and downlinked to Earth. It raises questions to how to best collect and process this data, and if that much data is even necessary.</li> </ul> <p>Again, some more thought-provoking quotes from today’s speakers:</p> <blockquote> <p>“As a community, we aren’t yet asking ‘how to do it?’, from the autonomous perspective.” — Dr. Danette Allen (NASA Langley Research Center)</p> <p>“We are a silicon-based society.” — Dr. Jessica Frick (Stanford University)</p> <p>“There’s no such thing as a good model, but some are useful.” — Dr. Rusty Powell (Axient)</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>All Days: SpaceCom Expo</strong></p> <p>There were over 200 exhibitors at the expo from every part of the industry. There were manufacturing and rocket component companies, software and data analytics companies, literal rocket launch companies, space education companies, NASA, Space Force Association, and many more. I enjoyed chatting with the exhibitors and learning about how they help support the space industry. It was an eye-opening experience for me to learn about how diverse the space industry is! Plus the ton of swag I got was a sweet bonus!</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2024-02-04-spacecom-conference-2024/6-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2024-02-04-spacecom-conference-2024/6-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2024-02-04-spacecom-conference-2024/6-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024-02-04-spacecom-conference-2024/6.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Some of the really cool swag I got from exhibitors includes (but not limited to) a NASA calendar, numerous mission patches, badges, and medallions, mugs, t-shirts, socks, a multi-purpose toolset, sunglasses, notebooks, and more! Source: author. </div> <h2 id="my-key-impressions-and-takeaways">My Key Impressions and Takeaways</h2> <ul> <li>Florida (or at least Orlando) is really beautiful, and I can see why people willingly move here (it’s not just for Disneyland!). It also really lives up to its ‘Sunshine State’ name. Also a key factor is its all-around booming economy, space and otherwise.</li> <li>The space sector is a rapidly growing economy that affects every one of us, and has a lot of opportunities for everyone, regardless of background. To me, it’s clear that now really is the time to jump on the space bandwagon, it’s literally the future — who doesn’t want to be involved in that?</li> <li>We are becoming closer and closer to a space-faring species. Things that you see in sci-fi books and media, like holographic technology, quantum computing, permanent lunar/Martian habitation, asteroid mining, building things in space, space cities, space tourism, and more are very quickly becoming a reality. There is still a lot of work to be done, but we’re definitely getting there. There’s a lot of government and commercial support for these initiatives.</li> <li>There are a lot of opportunities for collaboration across government, industry, and academia, both domestically and globally. There seems to be a clear willingness by all parties to work together, but there needs to be better messaging and communication.</li> <li>Some of the technical challenges that exist in the field include big data (so much data is being generated from satellites, sensors, and other instruments, and it’s difficult to process and generate insights in real time), space domain awareness (it’s difficult to gauge depth when visually tracking small satellites, debris, and more, but computer vision can be used to help with depth perception, among many other uses), accurately predicting space weather (solar activity and emissions affect all of us on earth — especially if solar flares knock out GPS comms! It’s important to predict solar activity and other radiation events), and more.</li> <li>There are also a lot of ‘traditional’ data challenges, like lack of standards, lack of data governance and management, silos of data that don’t communicate with each other, unnecessary or incomplete data collection, data storage issues, and more. I think this is where roles like Chief Data Officer come in, because it’s very important to have a solid infrastructure and strategy for dealing with data to enable insight discovery, which enables better decision-making.</li> <li>For me personally, after talking to very smart people (field experts), I gained clarity on how I might combine my astronomy and data science skills to help solve these technological challenges in this sector. I also learned about industry and government organizations and companies that work in the space sector, the types of roles that exist, and skillsets that are currently in demand. With this knowledge, I can continue to build my knowledge about the space domain, and work towards a career in this space (no pun intended).</li> <li>I liked how this conference was run. The day starts with 2–3 keynotes, after which there are multiple breakout sessions. What I found unique about this was that most of the breakout sessions were panel discussions, with thought leaders and space experts engaging in a live discussion (and sometimes heated debates) in response to questions from the moderator and audience. It was very engaging and cutting-edge to hear first-hand informed opinions on how to tackle different challenges in this sector. The conference organizers did a splendid job with logistics too!</li> </ul> <h2 id="orlando--florida">Orlando + Florida</h2> <p>This was my first time visiting Florida, and when I learned that Universal Studios and Disney World are located in Orlando where the conference is, I was so excited that I booked my stay for a few extra days beyond the conference! I stayed at the <a href="https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/mcoca-castle-hotel-autograph-collection/overview/?scid=f2ae0541-1279-4f24-b197-a979c79310b0">Castle Hotel, Autograph Collection</a>, which was not too far from either Universal Studios, or the Orange County Convention Center where SpaceCom was held.

With my newfound understanding of the space sector, my next steps are to stay involved with the space community, and keep learning more.</p> <p>I also had a great time touring Florida, having spent 3 days at Universal theme park, and a day at Kennedy Space Center. I definitely need to come back again to visit the rest of Florida’s vast number of attractions and soak up that sunshine!</p> <p>This blog post by no means covers everything that I learned during my 3 short days at SpaceCom, but it has given me a lot of food for thought, which I look forward to thinking and reflecting about in the next few days, and pursuing new avenues of research.

In this post, I will share some of my key takeaways on giving successful presentations to diverse audiences.</p> <h2 id="presenting-science-well">Presenting Science Well</h2> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2024-01-20-present-your-science/2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2024-01-20-present-your-science/2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2024-01-20-present-your-science/2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024-01-20-present-your-science/2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@brikelly?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Brian Kelly</a> on <a href="">Unsplash</a>. </div> <p>The premise we start with is an analogy of a bridge with a gap in between. On one side of the bridge’s gap, we have a representation of our research, which is very technical and detailed. On the other side of the bridge’s gap, we have a representation of our stakeholder. The obvious question is, how do we bridge this gap? How can we smoothly connect our research with our stakeholders? According to Marshall, “Science not communicated is science not done”, and this is very true.</p> <blockquote> <p>Science not communicated is science not done.</p> </blockquote> <p>There are three universal truths for presenting science well:</p> <ul> <li>Have a good story to tell.</li> <li>Have passion, enthusiasm, energy, and sincerity when you present.</li> <li>Have a sense of audience.</li> </ul> <p>To summarize these universal quotes, Marshall asserts that the most successful speakers are audience-centric, not speaker-centric. We must constantly ask ourselves, “What makes sense for my audience?”, because presentation success is always rooted in the audience.</p> <blockquote> <p>The most successful speakers are audience-centric, not speaker-centric.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="addressing-biases">Addressing Biases</h2> <p>For addressing the aforementioned gap in the bridge between our research and our audience, we must recognize biases, which act like a physical wall between us and the audience. Marshall identified two particular biases:</p> <ul> <li>Technical bias — assuming the audience already knows the technicalities of the topic at hand.</li> <li>Programmatical bias — asking for something (like time or money) from the stakeholders.</li> </ul> <p>To recognize these biases, we must address them explicitly to the audience, using phrases like “I know that [insert bias]”, or “I recognize these concerns you might have”. Doing so changes the atmosphere of the room and makes it more collaborative, because the audience now knows that you (the presenter) are aware of the audience’s concerns, and are on the same page as them.</p> <blockquote> <p>Success is always rooted in the audience.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some speaking tips Marshall recommended:</p> <ul> <li>Use metaphors and analogies whenever possible, audiences can relate more to the topic at hand.</li> <li>Take pauses when speaking, it allows the audience to think about the point(s) you are making.</li> </ul> <p>We will almost always encounter diverse audiences, in the sense that their backgrounds may differ to yours, and therefore it is important to keep in mind the ‘scuba/snorkel’ analogy.</p> <h2 id="the-scubasnorkel-analogy">The Scuba/Snorkel Analogy</h2> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2024-01-20-present-your-science/3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2024-01-20-present-your-science/3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2024-01-20-present-your-science/3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024-01-20-present-your-science/3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@hiro0718?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Hiroko Yoshii</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-in-black-and-white-suit-under-water-PSot6nZJelM?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>. </div> <p>Imagine we are taking the audience with us for a dive in the ocean (a metaphor for deep technical details). Some members of the audience will have scuba diving equipment, which will allow them to breathe underwater for long periods of time. Most audience members, though, will have snorkeling equipment, which requires them to frequently come up to the surface for some air.</p> <p>In other words, not many members of the audience may have the background required to understand the technical details of your presentation, and so it is important to take a ‘snorkeling strategy’, by allowing the audience to regularly come up for air. Specifically, after making a key technical detail (taking a deep dive in the ocean), make a ‘so what?’ statement to allow the audience to understand the relevance of the point (coming back up for air).</p> <p>These ‘so what’ statements might look like, “So, what this all means is that…”, or “This is important because…”, or “The next question this causes us to ask is…”. Doing this scuba/snorkel maneuver every slide or so allows the audience to connect the dots correctly, rather than making mis-connections between the key points.</p> <blockquote> <p>Audiences highly value speakers who are interpreters, not reporters, of the work.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another way to deal with excessive technical detail is to filter and prioritize important details, by being more objective. For this, it is important to keep in mind the ‘mountain view’ analogy.</p> <h2 id="the-mountain-view-analogy">The Mountain View Analogy</h2> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2024-01-20-present-your-science/4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2024-01-20-present-your-science/4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2024-01-20-present-your-science/4-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024-01-20-present-your-science/4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@ante_kante?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Ante Hamersmit</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-in-red-jacket-walking-on-green-grass-field-during-daytime-5GbN2LeeoyY?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>. </div> <p>Imagine we are a mountain trail guide, whose task it is to guide the audience on the trail up to the mountain peak for a fantastic view. We need to deliver the view to the audience, while keeping them on the trail. If we show the audience every rock and tree on the trail, we will lose a lot of audience members on the trail, who will not get to see the majestic view (your key takeaway).</p> <p>Therefore, when planning a presentation, we should start with the key ‘view’ we want to leave the audience with, and work backwards to identify the logical points the audience needs to get to that view. Keeping a clear structure with a core message is more convincing than a structure that can’t be followed.</p> <blockquote> <p>Clarity is confusing, confusion is costly.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="slide-design">Slide Design</h2> <p>In terms of slide design, it is all too easy to fall in the trap of adding too much text and details on the slide, but this only adds to cognitive overload. Instead, here are some slide design tips we should follow to ensure the slides serve the strategy, thinking, and messaging.</p> <ul> <li>Have a sentence headline, as an assertion, per slide.</li> <li>Have supporting visuals, like graphs, charts, tables, pictures, videos, equations, flowcharts, etc. to support the sentence headline.</li> <li>Almost any list of bullet points can be turned into a visual infographic. Do so.</li> <li>Use PowerPoint to your advantage, and create annotations to assist with your intended visual focus.</li> <li>Focus on relationships between the bullet points, and convert these to visual assists.</li> </ul> <h2 id="my-takeaways-and-impressions">My Takeaways and Impressions</h2> <p>Overall, the key message I took away from this workshop was to think in an audience-centric manner, and make things as simple as possible to allow the main message to shine through. Most of these methodologies were not new to me, personally, but it was a really good refresher on making effective and successful presentations to reach diverse audiences, whether those are business stakeholders, company leadership, conference attendees, or anyone else. I definitely enjoyed this workshop, and look forward to implementing these approaches in my future work!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="science-communication"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently had the pleasure of attending a ‘Present Your Science’ workshop hosted by Melissa Marshall.

We’ll look at data from the Data Science Stack Exchange website. We’ll keep the default options. Now let’s see what we find!</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>From 2014–2022, the top tag every year has consistently been Machine Learning! In 2014, there are about 200 posts tagged with <em>machine-learning</em>, but by 2016, there are more than 500 posts tagged with <em>machine-learning</em>! We see this tag sky-rockets after 2017 and peaks in 2018 with close to 1500 posts tagged, before gradually decreasing.</p> <p>Why is there a decrease in the number of posts tagged with <em>machine-learning</em>? Let’s look at the next graph to see.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/4-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>This graph shows the top 10 tags over time. The tag <em>machine-learning</em> dominates by a large margin, as the previous graph showed. It seems the second-most used tag is <em>python</em>, and then <em>deep-learning</em> after that. These tags also follow similar frequencies over time as <em>machine-learning</em>.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/5-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/5-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/5-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>This histogram shows the all-time frequencies of tags. Unsurprisingly, <em>machine-learning</em> leads, followed by <em>python</em> and <em>deep-learning</em>, <em>neural-network</em> and <em>classification</em>. So it seems that data scientists on this Stack Exchange are primarily only concerned with machine learning and Python, in addition to deep learning and neural networks. There’s no mention of other popular data science tools and techniques, like R, SQL or artificial intelligence, interestingly!</p> <p>So the last three graphs gave us insight into the popularity of tags on the forum, but what about community activity? As it turns out, the dataset contains data like CreationDate (date the question was created), LastActivityDate (date there was last any activity on the question, e.g. answers and comments), and ClosedDate (date the question was marked as ‘closed’). We can use these to get an idea of the community activity on the Data Science Stack Exchange over time.</p> <p>The default filtering options set the time range from Jan 1 2021 to Dec 17 2022 (date the dataset was downloaded). In this time range, we find that there were a total of 6673 questions asked, out of which only 28 were closed! This amounts to only 0.42% of questions closed! We also see there is a general upward trend in questions closed, indicating that newer questions tend to get closed, compared to older ones.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/6-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/6-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/6-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>In the same date range, we also see the average differences between question dates. The green line is the average difference between CreationDate and LastActivityDate, the blue line is the average difference between CreationDate and LastEditDate, and the red line is the average difference between CreationDate and ClosedDate.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/7-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/7-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/7-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-03-16-rshiny-stackexchange-analysis/7.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>For the average difference between CreationDate and LastActivityDate, we see that this difference is the lowest across all three categories, and has an average difference of 92 days over the time period, i.e. on average in this time period, the difference between a question’s creation and its last activity is 92 days, or about 3 months.</p> <p>Comparing LastEditDate, we see the average difference is 215 days since a question’s creation, indicating that questions do not tend to be edited as often as they get activity on them.</p> <p>The red line is the most interesting, and shows that the average difference between a question being asked and it being resolved is 381 days, or just above a year. In most cases, questions do not get closed, which is shown by the smooth boundary marker.</p> <p>This case study gave us a little insight into the Data Science community on Stack Exchange, and what’s trending. Evidently, the community is most interested in machine learning and Python, and while the community is very active, oftentimes questions may not get completely resolved quickly.</p> <p>For an introductory foray into this dataset, it sure yielded a lot of insight into trends in the Data Science field.
