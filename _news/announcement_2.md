I recently participated in my university’s [College of Engineering Annual Poster Competition](https://grad.engineering.uconn.edu/coe-poster-competition/), and won 1st place for my department (Department of Computer Science and Engineering)! This poster competition is for graduate students (Master’s and PhD) to showcase our research in a visually-compelling manner, and present it in 3 minutes or less to faculty judges outside our departments. I had a fantastic time presenting my poster, and learning from other participants.
